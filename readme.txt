Archived since this bot was never used in production and was more of a proof of concept. 

Bot I made for the VK&G Discord server. It assigns roles based on the first letter of your username or nickname on the guild when you join it or update your username/nick on the server. Don't judge me too harshly for this. I have never used Discord.JS before and I made this in 3 hours.

REQUIREMENTS

- NodeJS 12.x or greater (tested with 12.18.3)

HOW TO USE

1) Clone the repo `git clone (url)`
2) Downloaded the dependencies `npm install`
3) copy config_example.json to config.json and replace "Your Token Here" with your bot's token
4) Modify the rolesToAssign variable near the top of index.js to meet your requirements
5) run the bot `node index.js`
